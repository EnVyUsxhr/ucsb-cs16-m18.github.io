<li> (9 pts) The author describes the difference between "syntax errors" and "logic errors", and also the difference between syntax errors that produce an "error message" vs. those that produce a "warning message".  Briefly explain each of the items below in a way that makes the DIFFERENCES among them clear:
    <div style="margin-bottom:0.25em"></div>

  i. Syntax errors that result in an error message:
    <div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>
  ii. Syntax errors that result in an warning message:
    <div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>
  iii. Logic errors:
    <div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>
</li>

<li> (2 pts) If the following statement were in a C++ program, what would it do? Write the correct statement if there is a syntax error.
    <div style="margin-bottom:0.15em"></div>
<code>cout >> "I love oranges and apples";</code>

  <div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>
</li>

<li> (2 pts) If the following statement were in a C++ program, what would it do? Write the correct statement if there is a syntax error.
  <div style="margin-bottom:0.15em"></div>
<code>cout << "The world goes round and round"</code>
  <div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>
</li>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<li> (4 pts) Show 2 different ways to initialize variables in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>
</li>

<li> (4 pts) Is this variable declaration statement in C++ a good one? Why or why not?
<div markdown="1">
`double int = 30;`
</div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>
</li>

<li> (4 pts) How do you write the following in ONE LINE in C++: Subtract a from b and add that sum to c, then divide that result by d, and store the final result in e? Assume all variables are of type double.
  <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>
</li>

<li> (5 pts) Explain via an example what a "type mismatch" is. Also explain how compilers handle C++ statements that have a type mismatch?

  <div style="margin-bottom:10em"></div>
</li>

<li> (6 pts) Write an if-else statement that outputs the string "Grade is B" if the variable <code>score</code> is between 80 and 90 inclusively. Otherwise the if-else statement should output "Grade is not B"?
<div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>

<li> (4 pts) What is the output of the following C++ statements? <b>Explain why.</b>
<div style="margin-bottom:0.5em"></div>
<div markdown="1">

```
int x = 20, y = 5;

bool v, w;

v = (x != y);

w = ((x /= y) == 4);

cout << x << " " << y << " " << v << " " << w << endl;

```
</div>
